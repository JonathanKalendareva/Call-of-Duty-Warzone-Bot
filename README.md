# Call-of-Duty-Warzone-Bot
 
 Created a Discord bot that retrieves data from a Call of Duty Warzone API, I used Python to fetch the JSON data. Then parsed the JSON data and used a translation library to convert it into a readable format before outputting it to the Discord bot using the Discord API.

Utilized Infinity Ward's API to retrieve information and output it onto Discord to analyze basic statistical information on other players

I choose this project because I am an avid Discord user and Warzone player and also wanted to learn how to use API's, utilize JSON formats, create my own Discord bot and learn python along the way.
